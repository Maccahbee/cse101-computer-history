Introduction

The history of Computer Arts is a fascinating one, going back all the way to the 1950â€™s with the first computer art show. Computer Arts itself is defined as any form of graphic art, including photography, digital art, music, animation and more. Anything that could be considered an art, created on a computer, is considered a form of computer art. As a matter of fact, 2D and 3D art are both considered a part of digital art, and have their own histories. One thing that seems to be common with humanity has been the need to create art, and this is certainly no exception. From the development of specialized programs to various devices such as synthesizers, drawing tablets, and pens, computer arts have always been a part of technological development.
