Introduction

The history of Computer Arts is a fascinating one, going back all the way to the 1950’s with the first computer art show. Computer Arts itself is defined as any form of graphic art, including photography, digital art, music, animation and more. Anything that could be considered an art, created on a computer, is considered a form of computer art. As a matter of fact, 2D and 3D art are both considered a part of digital art, and have their own histories. One thing that seems to be common with humanity has been the need to create art, and this is certainly no exception. From the development of specialized programs to various devices such as synthesizers, drawing tablets, and pens, computer arts have always been a part of technological development.

Software

The phrase Digital Art was first coined in the 80’s, with the creation of AARON, which was an actual robot that could create pieces of art. However, digital art programs existed back in the 70’s, although for more official use such as the creation of vector images. Throughout the 80’s and 90’s, 2D art was prevalent, and the use of Paint began. The first digital art program was called MacPaint, which allowed for complete artistic freedom. Digital art has been a dominant style for so long, though as 3D programs started popping up, so did 3D art. Many 3D programs started with being used for mapping. Originally, 3D programs were only used in professional fields, or for movies and video games. This made these programs more inaccessible until the mid to late 1990’s, and immediately, it became another type of artistic medium. Digital music has an interesting history as well. The first singing computer was not actually in 1961 like most people think, but was dated back to 1951 instead, with a Ferranti Mark 1 computer singing various songs such as Baa Baa Black Sheep. In 1957, the first digital music program was created, with the name MUSIC. In 1983, saw the birth of possibly one of the most infamous forms of digital music creation, MIDI files. This allowed for compatibility with multiple programs, and allowed the computer to work more closely with the software. In 1989, the Cubase was released, and it was the first to include a horizontal timeline of the user’s work. Once computers started allowing audio recordings. This gave way to many more possibilities. The VST took full advantage of this, allowing users to record and save audio tracks. Meanwhile, the Cubase was updated to allow plug-in instruments, saving the sounds that you play on your own instruments. Reason released in 2001, becoming one of the most successful music programs due to its inclusivity. However, Ableton Live released just a year later, becoming one of the most famous computer softwares for similar reasons.
